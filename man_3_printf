NAME
       printf - format and print data

SYNOPSIS
       printf FORMAT [ARGUMENT]...

DESCRIPTION
       printf formats and prints data according to the FORMAT specification. It is similar to the C
       function printf() and provides a powerful way to format and display output.

OPTIONS
       The printf command supports various format specifiers, which begin with a percent sign (%) and are
       followed by one or more format characters. The most common format specifiers include:

       %c     Print a character.

       %s     Print a string.

       %d     Print a signed decimal.
       
       %i     Print a signed integer.

ARGUMENTS
       FORMAT A string that specifies the format of the output. It can contain plain text and format
              specifiers.

       ARGUMENT
              Values to be formatted and printed according to the format specifiers in the FORMAT string.

EXAMPLES
       To print a simple string:

              printf ("Hello, World!\n")

       To print a formatted integer:

              printf ("The answer is: %d\n")
